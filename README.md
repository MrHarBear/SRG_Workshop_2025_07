# Insurance Workshop - Enhanced Demo with Broker Integration

## Overview

This enhanced insurance demonstration showcases Snowflake's unified platform capabilities with a comprehensive three-entity data model: **CUSTOMERS (1,200) → BROKER_ID → BROKERS (20)** and **CUSTOMERS → POLICY_NUMBER → CLAIMS (1,001)**.

The workshop demonstrates how Snowflake provides a single, powerful platform that meets all data needs—from ingestion and transformation to governance and AI—with better TCO and faster time-to-value than componentized solutions.

## Workshop Architecture

### Three-Entity Data Model
- **CUSTOMERS**: 1,200 customer records with demographic and policy information
- **BROKERS**: 20 broker profiles with performance metrics and territory data  
- **CLAIMS**: 1,001 insurance claims linked to customers and policies
- **Relationships**: Customer-to-Broker (many-to-one) and Customer-to-Claims (one-to-many)

### Snowflake Features Demonstrated
- **Data Ingestion**: Automated pipeline with multiple data formats
- **Data Quality**: Data Metric Functions with real-time monitoring
- **Analytics**: Mixed SQL/Python UDFs with Dynamic Tables
- **Governance**: Progressive masking, row-level security, tagging
- **Sharing**: Secure data products with privacy protection
- **AI/ML**: Python UDFs for predictive analytics and risk modeling

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
- Streamlit environment for dashboard deployment
- Data files: `claim_data.csv`, `customer_data.csv`, `broker_profiles.json`

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Foundation Setup
Execute the foundation script to create the complete infrastructure:
```sql
-- Run in Snowflake worksheet
@00_AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_SETUP.sql
```

This creates:
- Database: `INSURANCE_WORKSHOP_DB`
- Schemas: `RAW_DATA`, `ANALYTICS`, `GOVERNANCE`, `SHARING` 
- Warehouses: `WORKSHOP_COMPUTE_WH`, `WORKSHOP_OPS_WH`
- Data ingestion pipelines for all three entities

#### 2. Data Quality Monitoring
Set up comprehensive quality monitoring with DMFs:
```sql
-- Run after foundation setup
@01_DATA_QUALITY.sql
```

Features:
- Custom DMFs mixing SQL and Python for optimal performance
- System DMF integration for standard metrics
- Automated quality scoring and alerting
- Cross-entity relationship validation

#### 3. Advanced Analytics and Governance
Deploy analytics and governance layers:
```sql
-- Run after data quality setup
@02_RISK_ANALYTICS_GOVERNANCE.sql
```

Includes:
- Mixed-language UDFs (Python for complex ML, SQL for performance)
- Three-level Dynamic Tables architecture
- Progressive governance policies
- Secure sharing views with masking

#### 4. Interactive Dashboards
Launch Streamlit dashboards for workshop demonstration:
```bash
# Data Quality Monitoring
streamlit run 01_data_quality_dashboard.py

# Broker Performance Analytics  
streamlit run 02_broker_performance_dashboard.py

# Risk Analytics Intelligence
streamlit run 03_risk_analytics_dashboard.py

# Governance Compliance
streamlit run 04_governance_dashboard.py
```
